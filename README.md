ACS: Accurate Condition Synthesis
============================
Notification
----------------
ACS can no longer execute on new bugs. The execution of ACS requires querying of GitHub, but GitHub recently changed its interface and does not allow programmed queries. Therefore, the original code of ACS cannot execute normally and there is no easy way to fix that. ACS can still run on the original Defects4J bugs as the results were cached.

If you are looking for a modern program repair tool on Java for experiments or for building your own, we would recommend our newest tool SimFix: https://github.com/xgdsmileboy/SimFix

I. Requirement
----------------
 - Ubuntu14.04
 - Java 1.7
 - Python 2.7(need to install psutil)
 - [Defects4J](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j)
 
II. How to run the ACS
---------------------
Two optional: A. run the virtual machine; B. Set up the environment. Choose the way you like.
### A. Run the virtual machine
1. If you do not want to set up the environment, please download the [virtual machine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B60sl-8vpnfEcVZkUVZCYXBvZlE/view?usp=sharing), unzip and open it by VmWare12.5.2(username: yjxxtd, password: hhxxttxs). 

2. There are 23 projects(18 correct and 5 incorrect) in the directory "/home/yjxxtd/software/defects4j-project/", the ACS is in the directory "/home/yjxxtd/software/ACS/ACS-master/". 

3. Please run the run.sh in the directory "/home/yjxxtd/software/ACS/ACS-master/" to generate the 23 patches for the 23 projects. 

4. If it does not work normaly,  please increase the timeout time in the run.sh, for example "java -jar ACS.jar /home/yjxxtd/software/defects4j-project/ Chart_14 timeout:3600".

### B. Set up the Environment
1. Clone the ACS:
  - `git clone https://github.com/Adobee/ACS.git`

2. Checkout a buggy source code version from Defects4j anc compile it:
  - `defects4j checkout -p Lang -v 1b -w /tmp/Lang_1`
  - `cd /tmp/Lang_1`
  - `defects4j compile`
 
 the forder name of checkout must format as '`ProjectName_buggyID`' because the ACS needs it's project name and buggy id to generate it's classpath, source path etc.

3. Run the Jar with the parent path of Defects4j buggy version project forder:
  - `java -jar ACS.jar /tmp/`
 
 and ACS will automatically find all formatted folder and run with it.

 Â Or run with specific buggy projects in `/tmp/` forder(Note the space between "/tmp/" and "Lang_1"):
  - `java -jar ACS.jar /tmp/ Lang_1`
  - `java -jar ACS.jar /tmp/ Lang_1;Lang_2;Lang_3`
  - `java -jar ACS.jar /tmp/ ban:Lang_1;Lang2`

  Or set a custom timeout seconds depends on your computer performance (default as 1800):
  - `java -jar ACS.jar /tmp/ Lang_1 timeout:3600`
  


III How to Build ACS 
--------------------
Althrough there is a `pom.xml` in the ACS, actually it's useless because of the difficulty of dependency configuration.

We prefer to use [Intellij IDEA](www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to build the ACS automatically.

1. 'Open' the ACS project with Intellij IDEA, and ignore all warnings in the bottom right, such as 'Framework detected'.

2. There is a default configuration in the run/debug menu which named `run ACS` in the top right, click it and choose `Edit configurations`, replace the content in several input box according to its tip.

3. Click `OK` button, and use shortcut `CTRL+F9` to build the project.

IV Tips
-----------------------
1. Tips of Chart19: After checkout from Defects4J, There are two `itext` jar files in `Chart_19/lib` folder and one of which named "itext-2.0.6.jar" is a broken jar and leads to the error of ACS, delete it and ACS would get back to normal.

2. The results are in the dir "ACS/resultMessage", the detailed patch is in the file "ACS/resultMessage/patchSource/Project_BugId_Schema_PatchId.java"(If a bug has n patches, the "PatchId" will range from 0 to n - 1),  and is between "patch begin" and "patch end".

3. Please note that the patch file in the directory "ACS/resultMessage/patchSource/" does not mean it passes all the tests. If it fails to pass all the test, the patch file will be deleted if ACS has enough time. So if you want to know whether the patch file pass all the tests, please apply it in the source code, and test it manually by using the command "defects4j test".

4. There are some pictures in the dir "ACS/pictures" to show how to run the ACS.

5. If ACS didn't generate the patch or the patch is incomplete, it maybe cause by the performance of the computer, please increase the timeout time.

V. Evaluation
----------------

### 1.ACS Correct Patches

ACS generates correct patches for 17 defects. For each defect, we provide the urls that contain the developer patch and we either identify the ACS patch is semantically equivalent to the developer patch and provide a brief analysis for why the ACS patch is correct.

>Analysis:The developer patch uses the trim() method, while ACS patch does not. However, the method createBigDecimal() will only be called by createNumber(), which ensures that
the parameter "str" does not contain any space. So calling trim() is not necessary and the two patches are identical.
