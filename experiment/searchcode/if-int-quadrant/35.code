/* Write a static method called quadrant that takes as parameters a pair of real numbers representing an (x, y) point and that returns the quadrant number for that point. Recall that quadrants are numbered as integers from 1 to 4 with the upper-right quadrant numbered 1 and the subsequent quadrants numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion:
quadrant(-2.3, 3.5) 	2
quadrant(-15.2, -3.1) 	3
quadrant(4.5, -42.0) 	4
quadrant(0.0, 3.14) 	0
