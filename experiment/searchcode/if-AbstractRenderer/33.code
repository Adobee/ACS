/**
* Defines an interface to control the visibility of individual items during rendering.
* Implementing classes can be used together with subclasses of {@link AbstractRenderer}
* to control the rendering process.<br>
* Works however only if the descendant of {@link AbstractRenderer} uses the per item method {@link AbstractRenderer#getItemVisible(int, int)}
